# Hi there 👋

## About me :mortar_board:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science at VIT University, Vellore. I am proficient in C++, C, Python, NodeJS, NestJS, JavaScript, TypeScript. I have worked on projects involving the use of MongoDB and MySQL databases. Projects that support the student and healthcare community using Machine Learning or a web-based application is what interests me the most.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My primary interest is server side web development and DevOps.
