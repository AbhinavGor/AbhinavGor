# Hi there 👋

## About me :mortar_board:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science at VIT University, Vellore. I got fascinated by the world of technology and computers specifically at a very young age. I like to learn new languages( both computer and human). I am proficient in C++, C, Python, NodeJS, ReactJS, JavaScript. I have worked on projects involving the use of MongoDB and MySQL database software. Projects that support the student and healthcare community using Machine Learning or a web-based application is what interests me the most.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My primary interest is Web development and DevOps. I have also worked on projects in a wide variety of fields including Deep Learning and DevOps. I have a considerable amount of experience with Single Board Computers(SBCs) like Raspberry Pi and Nvidia Jetson Nano.
