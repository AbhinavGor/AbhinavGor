# Hi ðŸ‘‹
I am a computer science graduate student at [Arizona State University](https://asu.edu). I am interested in the fields of backend development, DevOps, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing, and I am striving to enhance my expertise in these fields. Currently, I am actively engaged in research in the fields of time series analysis and image processing. My other interests include backend development and DevOps. AiOps is something I want to work on in the future.
